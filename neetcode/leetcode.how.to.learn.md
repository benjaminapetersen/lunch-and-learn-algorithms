# How I would learn Leetcode if I could start over

- Most full-stack jobs don't actually need algorithsm and data structures!
- But... too bad.
- Learning this stuff is still useful.
- It may at least get you a great job.
- And, it will at least help you be a better problem solver.

## Learning LeetCode is Hard

- Possibly harder than Calculus
- Possibly harder than Physics

Why is LeetCode hard? Harder than classes?

- Every time you think you are good, you will get a crazy problem that
  will destroy your confidence and make you think you suck. 
- Its not about intelligence
    - It is about systems
    - It is about process
    - It is about methodology

## The Mistake

- You can teach or learn something difficult a single time...but will forget.
- Repetition is key.
- Why is failure to repeat so hard?

You need to practice.
- But why is practice hard?
- Why does practice fail?

## The Solution

There are some core algorithms:
- `Binary Search`
- `Breadth First Search (BFS)`
- `Depth First Search (DFS)`
- `Sliding Window`
- `Two pointers` (used in sliding window, binary search)

Get really good at the basics.
Repeat the basics.
Get super good at the basics.
It won't take log to get good at the basics.

## The Target

- NOT "I want to solve a LeetCode problem quickly"
- INSTEAD "learn the fundamental algorithms"
- Once you understand all the basic algorithms, its easy to spot the 
  algorithms within the problems.
  - Take the algorithms and apply them to a problem.
- `Medium` problems on `LeetCode` are the `Key Interview Level Problems`.

## The Next Level

- Take a problem and apply a core algorithm...
- Then, asking the question
    - `Why does this algorithm work?`

Math is being able to argue why the math works in the first place.
Proofs.  Proofs prove the concept.

`Function signatures` are related to the idea of a mathematical `proof`.

Why?
Understand why.
Spend the time thinking about it.
There is no quick alternative to time spent understanding why.

Curiosity is key.
