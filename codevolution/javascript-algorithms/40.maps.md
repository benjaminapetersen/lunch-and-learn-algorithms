## Map

- A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, both key and 
  value can be of any data type
- To retrieve a value, use the coresponding key
- Maps are iterables

## Map vs Object

- Objects are unordered, maps are ordered
- Keys in objects are strings or symbols, keys in maps are any data type
- Objects have prototypes which may have keys that collide, maps do not 
  by default
- Objects are not iterable, maps are iterable
- Number of keys in objects must be calculated manually, maps maintain 
  a size property
- Objects may attach functionality via methods, Maps are restricted to 
  just data

## The Code

```javascript
let map = new Map([
    ['a', 1],
    ['b', 2]
]);

map.set('c', 3);

for (const [key, value] of map) {
    console.log(`key: ${key}, value: ${value}`);
}

map.has('a');

map.delete('c');

map.size; // similar to array.length

map.clear(); // all gone
```
