# What is an algorithm?

A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

Essentially:
- inputs
- algorithm
= output

A set of `well defined instructions`.

## Characteristics?

- Well defined inputs
- Well defined outputs 
- Steps should be clear and unambiguous
- language independent
    - the algorithm itself often can be lifted and implemented in any language

## Why learn them?

- Simply needed for solving problems
- Algorithms are techniques for efficiently solving problems
- One problem can be solved in many ways
- Each algorithm has its own tradeoffs
- Each can be measured (standard is with big-O notation)
