## Queue

- The queue data structure is a sequential collectio of elelemnts that follows 
  the principal of First in First Out (FIFO)
- The first element inserted into the queue is the first element removed
- Queue is an abstract data type. 
    - It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
- The Queue data structure supports two main operations:
    - Enqueue, add element to the rear/tail of the collection 
    - Dequeue, remove elmetns from the front/head of the collection

- Examples of usage:
    - Printers printing documents
    - CPU task scheduling
    - Callback queue in JavaScript runtime
