## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, sort the array.
Sorting can either be ascending or descending.
Quick sort uses recursion.

Implementation:
- Pick an element in the array for a pivot
    - Any element in the array is really fine
        - First elment
        - Last element
        - Random element
        - Median element
    - The fact that the element doesn't matter is initially surprising
- The role of the pivot?
    - Traverse the array from first to last-but-one element
    - Everything smaller than the pivot element into a left array
    - Everything that is greater than the pivot into a right array   
    - Repeat the process for the individual `left` and `right` arrays
        - Until you have an array of length 1
        - An array of length 1 is by definition sorted    
    - Once base condition is reached (Array of 1 element)
    - Repeatedly concatonate the left array, pivot, and right array
        - Until only one sorted array remains

Via its recursive nature, a visual of quick sort produces a tree.

## The Code

```javascript
const assert = require("assert").strict;

const moduleName = "quickSort";
console.log(`${moduleName} loaded \n--------`);

// Implementation:
// - Pick an element in the array for a pivot
//     - Any element in the array is really fine
//         - First elment
//         - Last element
//         - Random element
//         - Median element
//     - The fact that the element doesn't matter is initially surprising
// - The role of the pivot?
//     - Traverse the array from first to last-but-one element
//     - Everything smaller than the pivot element into a left array
//     - Everything that is greater than the pivot into a right array
//     - Repeat the process for the individual `left` and `right` arrays
//         - Until you have an array of length 1
//         - An array of length 1 is by definition sorted
//     - Once base condition is reached (Array of 1 element)
//     - Repeatedly concatonate the left array, pivot, and right array
//         - Until only one sorted array remains
function quickSort(arr) {
  // all recursive algorithms must have a base case.
  // an array of 1 item is sorted, by defintion.
  if (arr.length < 2) {
    return arr;
  }
  // the pivot is the critical component of the algorithm.
  // we will choose the last element, but as noted above,
  // it can be arbitrary.
  let pivot = arr[arr.length - 1];
  // we need a left array and a right array to split
  // our current array into
  let left = [];
  let right = [];

  // we loop the array and split the elements into the
  // appropriate left and right arrays, only sorting based
  // on the current pivot, not a comprehensive sort.
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    let testElem = arr[i];
    // simple comparison, it goes to one or the other
    if (testElem < pivot) {
      left.push(testElem);
    } else {
      right.push(testElem);
    }
  }
  // and now we call the function recursively
  // here is where we will build back up a new array.
  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}

module.exports = {
  [`${moduleName}`]: quickSort,
  // [`${moduleName}Optimized`]: somethingXOptimized,
};

console.log(`test cases.....`);

let testFunctions = [
  [`${moduleName}`, quickSort],
  // [`${moduleName}Optimized`, somethingXOptimized],
];

// input, output pairs
let testCases = [
  [
    [-5, 2, 10, 4, 6],
    [-5, 2, 4, 6, 10],
  ],
  [
    [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4],
    [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20],
  ],
  [
    [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4, 99, 0, -5, 2, 10, 4, 6],
    [-6, -5, -2, 0, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 99],
  ],
];

for (let funcI = 0; funcI < testFunctions.length; funcI++) {
  let funcName = testFunctions[funcI][0];
  let funcToTest = testFunctions[funcI][1];
  console.log(`\n${funcName}() test cases\n--------`);
  for (let testI = 0; testI < testCases.length; testI++) {
    let testInput = testCases[testI][0];
    let testOutput = testCases[testI][1];

    let testInputToLog = JSON.stringify(testInput);
    console.log(
      `case(${testI})`,
      `${funcName}(${testInputToLog})`,
      `solution: ${testOutput}`,
    );

    // since this function returns a new array
    // rather than sorting in place, we can
    // compare the output
    assert.deepEqual(funcToTest(testInput), testOutput);
  }
}

console.log("finish");

```

## Big-O: Analyze the Algorithm for Complexity

The quickSort function is recursive.  The call stack builds a tree,
which means it can get quite large as the input size increases.

- Worse Case Big-O: `O(n^2)` is the worst case complexity. If the 
  array is already sorted, we will always split the array into a 
  left[allElements] and right[noElements] which will then be `quadratic time`.
- Median (average) Case Theta Notation: `O(n log n)` pseudo-linear time.

The median case is what makes quick sort popular.  Often it is a 
reasonable time to sort an array.  Why?
- Recursively dividing array into sub-arrays is `O(log n)`, which is 
  logarithmic time.  This is great.  But it is not done.
- We also have a for loop, which is `O(n)`.
- Combined, `O(log n)` x `O(n)` = `O(n log n)` = pseudo-linear time.

Since it is unlikely to sort an already sorted array, the average case 
complexity is what matters.

It is also possible to implement this algorithm without extra space, which
may be favorable in some situations.  If space restraints are not an issue,
this current implementation is an acceptable algorithm to use.  If there are
space constraints, an alternative implementation may be desired.

## Simple Cheat Sheet

- `O(1)` is `constant time`
- `O(log n)` is `logarithmic time` 
- `O(n)` is `linear time`
- `0(n log n)` is `pseudo-linear time`
- `O(n ^ 2)` is `quadratic time` 
- `O(2 ^ n)` is `exponential time`
- `O(n!)` is `factorial time` 

## Conceptuals:

- loop of input is `O(n)` or `linear time`.
- nested loop of input is `O(n^2)` or `quadratic time`.
- input reduced by half is `O(log n)` or `logarithmic time`.

## Could we optimize?

Optimized solutions are solutions that perform better in terms of Big-O 
time complexity or space complexity analysis.  Often optimized solutions 
require specialized knowledge like bitwise operation or certain 
mathematical theorums or properties that may not be immediately obvious.

// optimized solution, if created
