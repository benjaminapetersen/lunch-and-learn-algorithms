There are multiple algorithms to solve any problem
Efficiency is how we measure algorithms
Space and time are the pivot points for measuring efficiency of algorithms

## Time Complexity

Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as function of input size

## Space Complexity

Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a functio of input size

By evaluating against hte input size, the analysis is not only machine independent, but 
the comparison is also more appropriate.

There is no one solutiont aht works every time.  It is always good to know multiple ways 
to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints.

If the app needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory, space complexity is not important.
If you have less memory to work with, choosing a slower solution that requires less space may be an option.

## How do we represent time and space complexity of an algorithm?

- `Asymptotic notations`
    - Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
    - `Big-O` notation (O-notation) - worst case complexity
    - `Omega Notation` (Ω-notation) - best case complexity
    - `Theta Notation` (Θ-notation) - average case complexity
