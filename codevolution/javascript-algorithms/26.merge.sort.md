## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, sort the array.

- Divide the array into sub-arrays, each containing only one element.
    - An array of 1 is considered sorted.
- Repeatedly merge the sub-arrays to produce new sorted sub-arrays until 
  there is only one sub-array remaining.  That will be the sorted array.

## The Code

```javascript

```

## Big-O: Analyze the Algorithm for Complexity

?????

## Simple Cheat Sheet

- `O(1)` is `constant time`
- `O(log n)` is `logarithmic time` 
- `O(n)` is `linear time`
- `0(n log n)` is `pseudo-linear time`
- `O(n ^ 2)` is `quadratic time` 
- `O(2 ^ n)` is `exponential time`
- `O(n!)` is `factorial time` 

## Conceptuals:

- loop of input is `O(n)` or `linear time`.
- nested loop of input is `O(n^2)` or `quadratic time`.
- input reduced by half is `O(log n)` or `logarithmic time`.

## Could we optimize?

Optimized solutions are solutions that perform better in terms of Big-O 
time complexity or space complexity analysis.  Often optimized solutions 
require specialized knowledge like bitwise operation or certain 
mathematical theorums or properties that may not be immediately obvious.

```javascript
// optimized solution, if created
