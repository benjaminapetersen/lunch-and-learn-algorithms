# Search Algorithms.

We will look at just 3 search algorithms:

- linear search
- binary search
- recursive binary search

But it may be beneficial to review other search algorithms outside
of the purview of this particular course.  Some other algorithms 
are:

- depth first search
- breadth first search
- jump search
- interpolation search

However, sorting algorithms seem to have more emphasis, and may 
be worth exploring before aditional search algorithms.
