## Problem Statement

Given a staircase of `n` steps, count the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.
You can either climb 1 step or 2 steps at a time.

Examples:
- n=1, climbingStaircase(n) = 1 = (1)
- n=2, climbingStaircase(n) = 2 = (1,1) and (2)
- n=3, climbingStaircase(n) = 3 = (1,1) (1,2) and (2,1)
- n=4, climbingStaircase(n) = 5 = (1,1,1,1) (1,1,2) (1,2,1) (2,1,1) and (2,2)
- n=5, climbingStairase(n) = 8 =
    (1,1,1,1,1) (1,1,1,2) (1,2,2) 
    (2,1,1,1) (2,2,1) 
    (1,2,1,1) (2,1,2) (1,2,1,1)
- n=6, climbingStaircase(n) = 13 =
    (1,1,1,1,1,1) (1,1,1,1,2) (1,1,2,2)
    (2,1,1,1,1) (2,2,1,1)
    (1,2,1,1,1,1) (1,2,2,1)
    (1,1,2,1,1) (1,1,1,2,1)
    (1,1,1,2,1)
    (2,2,1,1) (2,2,2)
    (2,1,2,1)
- etc.

Oddly, this becomes similar to the `fibonacci` sequence!  And that is one way to solve.

The approach:

The approach can be derived from the constraints.
- At any given time, you can climb either 1 step or 2 steps.
- If you have to climb to step `n`, you can only climb from step `n-1` or `n-2`.
    - So, calculate the ways we can climb to `n-1` and `n-2`, and add the two.
    - this makes the problem recursive.
- climbingStaircase(n) = climbingStaircase(n-1) + climbingStaircase(n-2);

This is interesting, and a clear example of not starting with `brute force`.
`brute force` for this problem might be:
- for step count `n`
- for `stepsToTake(2)` caclulate, with remainder, fill `1`.
    - repeat, decrementing the stepsToTake2 variable at each iteration
    - for example:
        - steps = 4
        - twoStepsSize = 2
        - oneStepSize = 1
        - for 4 steps at twoStepsSize, max is 2 r 0
            - decrement max by 1, now we have 1 r 2.  r is count of oneStepSize
    - for example:
        - steps = 5
        - twoStepsSize = 2
        - oneStepSize = 1
        - maxTwoStepsSize = 2
        - remainderTwoStepsSize = 5 % 2 = 1
        - while (maxTwoStepsSize > 0) 
          - remainder = 5 % maxTwoStepsSize;
        - result = [ count(maxTwoStepsSize), count(remainder) ]

This is not even pseudo-code, but somewhat captures a brute-force approach.
However, algorithms are often about finding patterns.
Manually running the algorithm multiple times reveals a pattern.

## The Code

```javascript
const assert = require("assert").strict;

const moduleName = "climbingStaircase";
console.log(`${moduleName} loaded \n--------`);

// Given 'n' stair steps in a staircase,
// count the number of distinct ways to climb to the top
// of the staircase.
// Steps can be taken 1 at a time, on in sets of 2.
function climbingStaircase(n) {
  // base cases for steps 1 and 2 are simply 1 and 2
  // this is similar to base case fibonacci
  // the climbingStaircase pattern does follow the
  // fibonacci sequence, so this makes sense.
  const noOfWays = [1, 2];

  // now we can build up the array all the way to the
  // nth value by incrementing i and simply adding the
  // previous two steps.
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    noOfWays[i] = noOfWays[i - 1] + noOfWays[i - 2];
  }

  // account for zero index of arrays in return.
  return noOfWays[n - 1];
}

module.exports = {
  [`${moduleName}`]: climbingStaircase,
  // [`${moduleName}Optimized`]: somethingXOptimized,
};

console.log(`test cases.....`);

let testFunctions = [
  [`${moduleName}`, climbingStaircase],
  // [`${moduleName}Optimized`, somethingXOptimized],
];

// input, output pairs
let testCases = [
  [1, 1],
  [2, 2],
  [3, 3],
  [4, 5],
  [5, 8],
  [6, 13],
  [7, 21],
];

for (let funcI = 0; funcI < testFunctions.length; funcI++) {
  let funcName = testFunctions[funcI][0];
  let funcToTest = testFunctions[funcI][1];
  console.log(`\n${funcName}() test cases\n--------`);
  for (let testI = 0; testI < testCases.length; testI++) {
    let testInput = testCases[testI][0];
    let testOutput = testCases[testI][1];

    console.log(
      `case(${testI})`,
      `${funcName}(${testInput})`,
      funcToTest(testInput),
      `solution: ${testOutput}`,
    );

    assert.equal(funcToTest(testInput), testOutput);
  }
}

console.log("finish");
```

## Big-O: Analyze the Algorithm for Complexity

Given we have one loop and it will iterate for as many times as the 
value we pass into it, our algorithm is `O(n)` linear time.

## Simple Cheat Sheet

- `O(1)` is `constant time`
- `O(log n)` is `logarithmic time` 
- `O(n)` is `linear time`
- `0(n log n)` is `pseudo-linear time`
- `O(n ^ 2)` is `quadratic time` 
- `O(2 ^ n)` is `exponential time`
- `O(n!)` is `factorial time` 

## Conceptuals:

- loop of input is `O(n)` or `linear time`.
- nested loop of input is `O(n^2)` or `quadratic time`.
- input reduced by half is `O(log n)` or `logarithmic time`.

## Could we optimize?

Optimized solutions are solutions that perform better in terms of Big-O 
time complexity or space complexity analysis.  Often optimized solutions 
require specialized knowledge like bitwise operation or certain 
mathematical theorums or properties that may not be immediately obvious.

```javascript
// optimized solution, if created
```

At this point, one could continue with manually writing out `9`, then `10`, etc.
However, one can also assess this pattern and see the appearance of the fibonacci 
sequence.  With this understanding, it is easier to optmize the algorithm.


## SCRATCH SHEET WITH ERRORS:

Attempting to visualize a pattern here becomes tricky.  
I wrote out several ways to do this without actually resolving algorithm.

- n=6, climbingStaircase(n) = 13 =
    start with 1s, then swap in 2s from the end working backwards: 
        (1,1,1,1,1,1) (1,1,1,1,2) (1,1,2,2)
    start with 2s, then swap in 1s from the end working backwards: 
        (2,2,2) (2,2,1,1) (2,1,1,1,1)
    start with (1,2), 1 from top: 
        (1,2,1,1,1) (1,2,2,1)
    start with (1,2,2), 1 from top: 
        (1,2,2,1)
    start with (2,1), 1 from top: 
        (2,1,1,1,1)-REPEAT
        (2,1,1,2)
        (2,1,2,1)
    start with (2,1,2), 1 from top:
        (2,1,2,1)
    start with (1,2,1), 1 from top:
        (1,2,1,1,1)-REPEAT
        (1,2,1,2)
This sort of reveals a pattern, but not as clearly as I would like.

How about some initial base patterns?
- `(1,1,1,1,1,1)` full.
    - is there a sensible way to programmatically create permutations?
    - what does a `swap 2` do:
        - `(1,1,1,1,2)` = 6
        - `(1,1,1,2,1)` = 6
        - `(1,1,2,1,1)` = 6
        - `(1,2,1,1,1,1)` = 6
        - `(2,1,1,1,1,1)` = 6
    - so now what?
        - `swap 2,2`? (cycle down the pair `2,2,`)
            - `(1,1,2,2)` = 6
            - `(1,2,2,1)` = 6
            - `(2,2,1,1)` = 6
        - `pin 2, swap 2`? (pin a `2` at the end, cycle down a `2`)
            - `(2,1,2)` = 5, need to add a `(1)` at the end to solve this
- `(2,2,2)` full.
    - is there a sensible way to programmatically create permutations?
    - what does a `swap 1` do:
        - `(2,2,1)` = 5 need additional `(1)`
        - `(2,1,2)` = 5 need additional `(1)`
        - `(1,2,2)` = 5 need additional `(1)`
    
Some other visual attemts:
- 13 permutations manually?
    - `(1,1,1,1,1,1)`: (1,1,1,1,1,1): 1
    - `(1,1,1,1,2)`: (1,1,1,1,2): 1
    - `(1,2,1)`: (1,2,1,1,1,1) (1,2,1,1,2): 2
    - `(1,2,2)`: (1,2,2,1): 1
    - `(2,1)`: (2,1,1,1,1,1) (2,1,1,2) (2,1,2,1): 3
    - `(2,1,2)`: (2,1,2,1)-REPEAT: 1
    - `(2,2,1)`: (2,2,1,1): 1
    - `(2,2,2)`: (2,2,2): 1
    - `(2,1,2,1)`: (2,1,2,1)-REPEAT: 1
    - this is tricky to work out as a programmatic pattern.
    - this is incomplete
