## Graph

- A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of
  vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges.
- Trees are a specific type of graph data structure.

An example of a graph:

B
├── A
├── C

But better:

  B
 / \
A   C

A directed graph would include arrows in a particular direction

B
├──> A
├──> C

Or

A -> B -> C

These get more complicated with many nodes.

An undirected graph does not include arrows, like the original example:

B
├── A
├── C

  B
 / \
A   C

A - B - C traversal
C - B - A traversal

Based on the characteristics of their edges, graphs can be categorized into 
two types:
- directed
    - A graph in which the edges have directions
    - Edges are usually represented by `arrows` pointing 
      in the direction the graph can be traversed
- undirected
    - A graph in which the edges are bidirectional
    - The graph can be traversed in either direction
    - THe absence of `arrows` tells us that a graph is undirected

## More Graph Types

Each of these has a different visual that is worth looking up:

- Only vertices, no edges
- Multiple edges from node
- Cycles in Graph
- Self-loops on nodes 
- Disconnected nodes
- Weights on edges representing cost of traversing the edge

## Real world usage

- Google maps, cities are vertices, roads are edges
- Social Media site, users are vertices, links are edges

## Graph Representation

Graphs are commonly represented in 2 ways:

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## Adjacency Matrix

- A 2D array of size VxV where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- Each row and column represents a vertex
- If the value of any element such as `matrix[i][j]`is 1, it represents that 
  there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.

For graph:

  B
 / \
A   C

The adjacencly matrix represented is:

    A  B  C
   --------
A | 0  1  0
B | 1  0  1
C | 0  1  0

If B,B had a `1` that would represent a self-link.
The above table can be represented by a 2D array in JavaScript like this:

```javascript
// the above as a 2D array
const matrix = [
    [0,1,0],
    [1,0,1],
    [0,1,0]
]

console.log(matrix[0][1]); // 1, connetion B to A
console.log(matrix[1][0]); // 1, connection A to B
console.log(matrix[1][1]); // 0, no self loop from B to B
```

## Adjacency List 

- Vertices are stored in a map-like data structure
    - every vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices

For graph:

  B
 / \
A   C

The corresponding adjacency list representation:

A -> B
B -> A,C
C -> B

```javascript
// represent adjacent nodes
let adjacencyList = {
    "A": ["B"],
    "B": ["A", "C"],
    "C": ["B"]
}
// find the adjacent nodes
console.log(adjacencyList["A"]);
```

## Adjacentcy Matrix vs Adjacency List

- With an adjacency list, we only need to store the values for the edges that exist.
- With adjacency matrix, you store the values irrespective of wether an edge exists
  or not.  Storage wise, an adjacency list is far more efficient.
- With adjacency list, inserting and finding adjacent nodes is constant time 
  complexity, whereas with adjacency matrix, it is linear time complexity.
- An adjacency list allows you to store additional values with an edge, such as
  weight of the edge.  With adjacency matrix, such information would have to be 
  stored externally.


## The Code

```javascript
const assert = require("assert").strict;

const moduleName = "Graph";
console.log(`${moduleName} loaded \n--------`);

// UndirectedGraph?
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    // adjacency list vs adjacency matrix?
    // generally, an adjacency list seems to
    // have an edge over an adjacency list.
    // however, use case matters!
    this.adjacencyList = {};
  }
  // a Vertex is a node.
  // the adjacencyList will track the
  // graph of edges between nodes.
  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
      // an empty list of edges
      // this could be just an array,
      // but for performance a set is better.
      this.adjacencyList[vertex] = new Set();
    }
  }
  removeVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
      return;
    }
    // if the vertex exists,
    // we need to remove all edges pointing to it
    // as well as removing it from the adjacency list.
    // this is actually not difficult.
    let vertexToRemove = this.adjacencyList[vertex];
    for (let adjacentVertex of vertexToRemove) {
      this.removeEdge(vertex, adjacentVertex);
    }
    // once all of the edges are gone, we can remove the vertex
    delete this.adjacencyList[vertex];
  }
  // Add an edge between two vertices.
  addEdge(vertexA, vertexB) {
    // initially, we need to ensure both vertexes exist
    if (!this.adjacencyList[vertexA]) {
      this.addVertex(vertexA);
    }
    if (!this.adjacencyList[vertexB]) {
      this.addVertex(vertexB);
    }
    // then we establish connections between them
    // since this is not directed, we need to maintain both
    this.adjacencyList[vertexA].add(vertexB);
    this.adjacencyList[vertexB].add(vertexA);
  }
  hasEdge(vertexA, vertexB) {
    return (
      // for certainty, we check both, though we know
      // we build both
      this.adjacencyList[vertexA].has(vertexB) &&
      this.adjacencyList[vertexB].has(vertexA)
    );
  }
  removeEdge(vertexA, vertexB) {
    this.adjacencyList[vertexA].delete(vertexB);
    this.adjacencyList[vertexB].delete(vertexA);

    for (let vertex in this.adjacencyList) {
      toDisplay.push([
        vertex,
        "->",
        // the spread operator will turn the set into an array
        [...this.adjacencyList[vertex]],
      ]);
    }
    toDisplay.forEach((row) => {
      console.log.apply(this, row);
    });
    // so we can assert with tests.
    return toDisplay;
  }
}

module.exports = {
  [`${moduleName}`]: Graph,
};

console.log(`test cases.....`);

// in case we implement multiple similar with different
// implementation details.
let testStructures = [[`${moduleName}`, Graph]];
