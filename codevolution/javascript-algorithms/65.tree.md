## Tree

- A Tree is a heirarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and
  queues, which are linear data structures.
- In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size
  of the data set.
    - Trees, however, owing to the nonlinear nature, allow quicker and easier access
      to the data.
- A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

## Visual

Trees are Nodes and Edges, where Edges are represented by lines.

Node A
├── Node B
│   ├── Node D
│   ├── Node E
└── Node C
    ├── Node F
    └── Node G

## Usage

- File system for directory strucutre
- Family tree
- Organization tree
- DOM 
- Chat bots
- Abstract Syntax Trees

## Terminology

- Parent Node: immediate predecessor of any node
- Child Node: immediate successor of any node
- Root Node: the node from which the tree originates, does not have a parent node
- Leaf Node: a node with no child nodes
- Siblings: nodes with the same parent
- Ancestor nodes: any node up the tree, such as the parent's parent
- Path: the sequence of edges from one node to another 
- Distance: the number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes

## Properties

- Degree of Node: the number of child nodes a node has.  Example: Degree(B)=2 means B has 2 children
- Degree of Tree: the maximum degree of a node within the tree
- Depth of Node: the number of edges from the root to the node
    - Count from root down to node
- Depth of Root Node: always 0
- Height of Node: the number of edges from the deepest leaf to that node 
    - Count from deepest leaf up to node 
- Height of Root Node: Heigh of the tree, root to the furthest leaf

## For Interviews

- Rarely a generic tree
- Usually a binary search tree
