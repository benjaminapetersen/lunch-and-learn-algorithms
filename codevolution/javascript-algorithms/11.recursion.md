# Recursion

What is it?
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions
to a smaller instance of the same problem.

Recursion is when a function calls itself.

Why?
A great technique to simplify your solution.
If you find yourself breaking down the problem into smaller versions of the same 
problem, recursion is very useful.

## Points About Recursion

- Every recursive algorithm requires a base case.
    - The base case is what breaks an infinite loop.
- A recursive solution might solve a problem, but it may not be faster.
    - A recursive solution may be far worse than an iterative solution!
- Recursion is complex.
