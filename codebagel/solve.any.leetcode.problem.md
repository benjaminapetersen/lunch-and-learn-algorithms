A systematic approach is needed.
Every question can be broken down into simple steps, no matter how complicated it seems.

## 1. Simplify the Problem

Eliminate the fluff that is hiding what matters.
Every question is the same in nature.
Given certain inputs, create the appropriate outputs.

State:
- the inputs are these
- we do this to the inputs
- these are the outputs

`Ask clafiying questions`.
Catch the edge cases.

## 2. Pattern Recognition

- Must understand `Big-O` 
- Must understand `Data Structures` and `Algorithms`

Can't pattern match without the tools to match the pattern!

Steps to break down a problem
- 1. Identity the straightfoward decision
    - Identify the time complexity 
    - This may help you identify opportunities for optimization
- 2. Identify the optimal solution
