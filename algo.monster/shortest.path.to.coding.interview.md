# Patterns: The Shortest-Path Algorithm for Coding Interviews

- https://algo.monster/problems/stats

Given the possible algorithms you could study,
take a look at the % chance each of these algorithms 
will appear in a coding interview,
and study those.

## Trends 

There are trends provided at the link above.  In summary:

- `Highest ROI`: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Two Pointers

These make up a good portion of `all interview problems`.
DFS can be used to solve a variety of graph, tree and combinatorial problems.

- `Second highest ROI`: Linked List, Stack, Queue

Asked often, but not many variations.
Classics are great

- `Third highest ROI`: Priority Queue, Heap

There are some classics for these as well

- `Fourth highest ROI`: Greedy, Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is rare, except for perhaps Google interviews.
    DFS + memoization often solves a dynamic programming problem.
Greedy problems are difficult to pattern match.
    Correctness often requires vigorous mathematical proofs.

- `Fifth` Trie, Union, Find 

Not often

- `Sixth`, Ad-hoc

Lots of problems are simple ad-hoc problems.  Just practice programming.
